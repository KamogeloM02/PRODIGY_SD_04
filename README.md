Set values are saved in a 2D array at the beginning of the Sudoku game. Zero is used to indicate empty cells. Fixed numbers are disabled, making it impossible to alter them, and these values are loaded into the GUI. The missing cells are subsequently filled in using a backtracking technique, which displays the puzzle that has been solved.
